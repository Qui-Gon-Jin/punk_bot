```Rolls are looking the same as they presented in a corebook:

!r *stat* *skill*
!r 4 6

If you need some extra of d10 dices
!r *number_of_dices*d*dice_type*
!r 4d10

Also bot is able to calculate your initiative
!i *REF*
!i 6

You can request percent check from a bot by typing
!r %

Implemented modificators option, whiuch can be used with every other base comand like this
(Dividing is automatically rounds down, according to corebook)
!r 3 4 +4
!r 4 5 -1
!r 2 8 *2
!r 3 2 /2
!i 3 +4
!r % +25

Also bot counts natural roll 1 as fail and marks it, as well as 10 will be critical success.
Every result equal 0 or less will be considered as 1.

Wish you nice time <3```
